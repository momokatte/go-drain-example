# go-drain-example

An example command-line app which reads strings from STDIN or a file, processes them concurrently, and writes them to STDOUT or a file.

This project exists for the purpose of testing, benchmarking, and demonstrating practical working examples for the [go-drain package](https://github.com/momokatte/go-drain).
